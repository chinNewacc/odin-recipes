    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A standing rib roast, also known as a prime rib roast, is a cut of beef from the primal rib. It's called a
        standing rib roast because it's usually cooked "standing" on the bones (so that the meat doesn't touch the pan).
    </p>
    <p>Prime rib is generally considered a superior cut of beef: It's tender, juicy, and wonderfully flavorful.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (5 pound) beef standing rib roast, at room-temperature (let sit out for 1 hour before starting recipe)
        </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a rack in a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Combine salt, pepper, and garlic powder in a small cup.</li>
        <li>Place room-temperature roast on the rack in the roasting pan with the fatty side up and the rib side on the
            bottom. Rub the seasoning onto the roast.</li>
        <li>Roast for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Turn the oven off and leave the roast inside for 3 hours, without
            opening the door.</li>
        <li>Turn the oven back on to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and reheat the roast for 30 to 40 minutes. The
            internal temperature should be at least 145 degrees F (62 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before carving.</li>
    </ol>
